# Infinite Scrollable Table with Sorting and Searching

This project implements an infinite scrollable table in React with features like sorting and searching. It fetches data from a JSON file containing dummy college data and displays it in a table format. Users can search for colleges by name, sort the table based on different criteria, and scroll infinitely to load more data.

## Features

- Sorting: Sort the table based on college name, rating, fees, or user review rating in ascending or descending order.
- Searching: Filter colleges by their name using the search input field.
- Infinite scrolling: Load more data as you scroll to the bottom of the page.


## Usage

1. Access the application in your browser at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
2. Use the search input field to search for colleges by name.
3. Click on the table headers to sort the table based on different criteria.
4. Scroll to the bottom of the page to load more data.
